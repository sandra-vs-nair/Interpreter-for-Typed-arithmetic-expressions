# Interpreter for Typed arithmetic expressions.

This project aims to create an interpreter for Typed arithmetic expressions using python language. The line input by the user is tokenized and converted into a nested list where each component list represents a step of derivation tree (left to right in list : root to leaf in tree). If the term in typable, predefined rules of the language is applied in the reverse order (right to left in list : leaf to root in tree) recursively until a value is produced.The language used in this project is the language of typed arithmetic expressions specified in the book "Types and Programming Languages" by Benjamin C. Pierce. Please note that the language is extended by a new term 'and-or-not'.
